# <Margaret-Delaney-Portfolio>

## Description

This homework assignment focused on making a personal portfolio website from scratch, using original HTML and CSS code. Specifically, styling headings, navigation bar, paragraphs, images, and responsive design.

Through a process of trial and error, I learned how to create responsive design using flex boxes, and ended up applying them to not only my portfolio content, but also to my navigation bar and footer. 

This homework assignment meets all the acceptance criteria listed below:
- Must contain developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    - You will see clearly the name Margaret Delaney, my photo, and a navigation bar with links cooresponding to the "about me," works, and contact information
- The links in the navigation must scroll to the corresponding section
    - The navigation links are working appropriately to take the user to the corresponsing section using href
- The link to the section about the work scrolls to a section with the developer's applications
    - If you click on "work experience" in the nav bar, it will scroll to the Work Experience section with links to deployed projects
- The first application image should be larger in size than the others
    - The first box is twice as large as the remaiing boxes using width percentage of 100% for the flex box
- The links on the applications must go to the deployed application
    - Clicking on each link will take you to the deployed websites
- The layout is responsive
    - The works boxes will stack evenly when the screen is smaller than 1101px, and the navigation bar and footer will also flex into a vertical column when the screen is smaller than 700px.

This project is ultimately a personal portfolio website with an "About Me" section, a "Work Experience" section, and contact information. This website was created to demonstrate not only my portfolio of work, but to demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS.

## Usage

If you want to check that all links are working correctly, go ahead and click on each link in the navigation bar, works section, and footer. You will know you are about to click a link because hovering over it will turn it a dark red color. If you are in the nav bar, you will see an emoji appear next to the link.

If you want to check for responsiveness, right click on the page and click "Inspect" from the drop down menu. There is a bar to the right of the page with two vertical dashes. Click and hold the dashes and move the mouse inwards, this will "shrink" the page and allow you to see the boxes, nav bar and footer stack vertically for smaller screens.

If you want to check that the image is accessible to screen readers, you can right click on the image, click "Inspect" from the drop down menu, and the description should appear in a separate chrome dev tool column.
